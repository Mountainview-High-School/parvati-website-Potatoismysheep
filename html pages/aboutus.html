        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h3>
            At Parvati, we understand that we are not all the same. Our bodies function in different ways and we have different dietary needs that need to be catered for. 
            Our mission is to provide food that not only tastes great, caters to you but is different to any other restaurant in the community. 
            Our name stems from the Hindu goddess of food and nutrition. 
            We serve breakfast, dinner and dessert to set our restaurant apart. 
            As a local restaurant we hope to provide a menu that incorporates locally grown produce so that we can give back to the community.
            We will also hope to raise money for different charities and fundraisers from our breakfast range. 
            
        </h3>
